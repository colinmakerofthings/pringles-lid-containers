# pringles-lid-containers
**A range of 3D printable containers designed to fit Pringles lids**
I wanted to create some small, customised containers that I could quickly grab on the go. I designed the containers to use a standard Pringles lid. The lid fit is quite tight to ensure it doesn't accidentally pop off (once you pop, you can't stop). Support material is not required.

**GoPro 7 Container**
A simple container designed to hold a GoPro 7, 2 extra batteries, a micro SD adapter card and 5 extra micro SD cards (one in the adapter).
