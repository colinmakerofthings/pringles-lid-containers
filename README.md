# pringles-lid-containers
A range of small, 3D printable containers designed to fit Pringles lids. I wanted these to be fully customised containers that I could quickly grab on the go. The lid fit is quite tight to ensure it doesn't accidentally pop off (once you pop, you can't stop). Support material is not required.

[GoPro 7 Container](https://github.com/colinmakerofthings/pringles-lid-containers/tree/main/GoPro%207%20Pringles%20Container)
A simple container designed to hold a GoPro 7, 2 extra batteries, a micro SD adapter card and 5 extra micro SD cards (one in the adapter).
